## The simCNNDTA model has been reproduced using pytorch library.
## The archictecture and the methods have been descriped in the original work of authors in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83679-y)
The Jupyter notebook `process_data_dataset.ipynb` is used to create the files required as input for the preprocessing of the data.

The jupyter notebook `sim-CNNDTA_model*.ipynb` is used to training and evaluating the model
